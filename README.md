## 🚀 Software Engineer – Robotics, Automotive & Embedded AI

I am a software engineer specializing in building complex, high-performance systems for robotics and autonomous vehicles.

My hands-on experience has been forged in high-stakes environments, from a 6-month internship at **KAERI** to working, via an SI company, 
on autonomous driving software projects for a **Tier-1 automotive supplier**.

During my academic years, I contributed to **two 1st-place project victories** (including a Minister’s Award).  
In these projects, I worked on the **perception and system integration layer** – designing Docker-based development/operation environments, integrating C++/ROS modules, and making sure the system ran reliably on the target hardware.

My strength lies in understanding the full stack – from hardware-level C/C++ optimization to app-level user experience.  
My current focus is to **bridge the gap** between robust **systems implementation** and **core AI / perception models** that run on embedded platforms.
